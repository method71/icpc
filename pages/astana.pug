				h1.b-sight__title Baiterek Monument
				p The Baiterek monument is not only the main attraction of Astana, but also one of the most significant symbols of sovereign Kazakhstan. Baiterek symbolizes a state that has preserved its historical roots, has a solid foundation and aspires to future prosperity. There is another, epic interpretation of the Monument's meaning. According to legend, Baiterek is the Tree of Life, to which the sacred bird Samruk aspires. Samruk takes refuge in its high crown to lay a golden egg – the Sun that gives life and hope. But underneath, Aidakhar is hiding between the roots – an evil dragon who wants to eat an egg. This is how the eternal struggle of good against evil is presented. This is how the Kazakh version of the universe looks like.
				p The monument’s top floor stands at a symbolic 97 meters, representing the 1997 when Astana was proclaimed the new capital of Kazakhstan.
