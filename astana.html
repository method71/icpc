          <p>The city is primarily known for its unusual architecture.

The first two were designed by world-famous architect Sir Norman Foster. In August 2022, the largest mosque in Central Asia and one of the largest mosques in the world opened its doors to worshippers. Moreover, the city center contains the Baiterek Monument which is considered to be the symbol of Astana.</p>

          <h1 class="b-sight__title">Baiterek Monument</h1>
          <p>The Baiterek monument is not only the main attraction of Astana, but also one of the most significant symbols of sovereign Kazakhstan. Baiterek symbolizes a state that has preserved its historical roots, has a solid foundation and aspires to future prosperity. There is another, epic interpretation of the Monument's meaning. According to legend, Baiterek is the Tree of Life, to which the sacred bird Samruk aspires. Samruk takes refuge in its high crown to lay a golden egg – the Sun that gives life and hope. But underneath, Aidakhar is hiding between the roots – an evil dragon who wants to eat an egg. This is how the eternal struggle of good against evil is presented. This is how the Kazakh version of the universe looks like.</p>
          <p>The monument’s top floor stands at a symbolic 97 meters, representing the 1997 when Astana was proclaimed the new capital of Kazakhstan.</p>

          <p>Nur Alem Museum of Future Energy is a unique structure in the world, as it is made in the form of a sphere with a diameter of 80 meters. The sphere was built as the central pavilion for the international specialized exhibition EXPO 2017, which focused on «Future Energy». Therefore, it is also known as the Museum of Future Energy.</p>
          <p>Nur Alem occupies 8 floors, each of which reflects its own concept: "Future Astana ", "Space Energy", "Solar Energy", "Wind Energy", "Biomass Energy", "Kinetic Energy", "Water Energy" and "National Pavilion" located at the base of the sphere.</p>
          <p>Solar panels are integrated into the sphere and two silent wind generators are installed. They convert solar and wind energy into electricity. Thus, they ensure a reduction in energy consumption of the pavilion by up to 20 percent, which makes the building one of the most environmentally friendly in the world.</p>
